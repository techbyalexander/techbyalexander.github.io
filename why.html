        <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
        <p>
            I think that dogs are a lot better than cats for many different reasons. Most of the time, dogs are more loyal than cats and would always want attention from you. Their able to protect you too because of how loyal they are. They are also very playful unlike a lot of cats who are very lazy most of the time. Overall I think dogs are better than cats since they are more playful and loyal to the owner.
